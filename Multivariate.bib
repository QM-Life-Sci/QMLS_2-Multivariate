  abstract    = "The nutritional environments that organisms experience are
                 inherently variable, requiring tight coordination of how
                 resources are allocated to different functions relative to the
                 total amount of resources available. A growing body of
                 evidence supports the hypothesis that key endocrine pathways
                 play a fundamental role in this coordination. In particular,
                 the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) and
                 target of rapamycin (TOR) pathways have been implicated in
                 nutrition-dependent changes in metabolism and nutrient
                 allocation. However, little is known about the genetic basis
                 of standing variation in IIS/TOR or how diet-dependent changes
                 in expression in this pathway influence phenotypes related to
                 resource allocation. To characterize natural genetic variation
                 in the IIS/TOR pathway, we used >250 recombinant inbred lines
                 (RILs) derived from a multiparental mapping population, the
                 Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource, to map
                 transcript-level QTL of genes encoding 52 core IIS/TOR
                 components in three different nutritional environments
                 [dietary restriction (DR), control (C), and high sugar (HS)].
                 Nearly all genes, 87\%, were significantly differentially
                 expressed between diets, though not always in ways predicted
                 by loss-of-function mutants. We identified cis (i.e., local)
                 expression QTL (eQTL) for six genes, all of which are
                 significant in multiple nutrient environments. Further, we
                 identified trans (i.e., distant) eQTL for two genes, specific
                 to a single nutrient environment. Our results are consistent
                 with many small changes in the IIS/TOR pathways. A
                 discriminant function analysis for the C and DR treatments
                 identified a pattern of gene expression associated with the
                 diet treatment. Mapping the composite discriminant function
                 scores revealed a significant global eQTL within the DR diet.
                 A correlation between the discriminant function scores and the
                 median life span (r = 0.46) provides evidence that gene
                 expression changes in response to diet are associated with
                 longevity in these RILs.",

               for the specific needs of ecologists and makes statistics more
               applicable to their course of study. Multivariate Statistics for

               in ecological applications and the relationships among various
               techniques, while avoiding detailed mathematics and underlying

               type of research questions best handled by each technique and
               the important considerations in applying each one. Whether used
               as a textbook for specialized courses or as a supplement to

               that students of ecology and natural resources most need to

               real wildlife data sets analyzed using the SAS statistical

               upper-division and graduate students in wildlife biology,
               forestry, and ecology, and for professional wildlife scientists

                 needed to make rigorous probability statements about the
                 effects of factors and their interactions in experiments.
                 Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis
                 of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues,
                 however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most
                 ecological multivariate data sets. Non‐parametric methods,
                 based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper
                 describes a new non‐parametric method for multivariate
                 analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press).
                 It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to
                 provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation
                 for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement
                 the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press)
                 for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on
                 previous non‐parametric methods because it allows a direct
                 additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does
                 this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal
                 assumptions of other non‐parametric methods. The
                 test‐statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F‐ratio
                 and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or
                 dissimilarity matrix. P‐values are then obtained using
                 permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests
                 involving several factors, including factorial and
                 hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.",

  abstract    = "Several permutation strategies are often possible for tests of
                 individual terms in analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) designs.
                 These include restricted permutations, permutation of whole
                 groups of units, permutation of some form of residuals or some
                 combination of these. It is unclear, especially for complex
                 designs involving random factors, mixed models or nested
                 hierarchies, just which permutation strategy should be used
                 for any particular test. The purpose of this paper is
                 two-fold: (i) we provide a guideline for constructing an exact
                 permutation strategy, where possible, for any individual term
                 in any ANOVA design; and (ii) we provide results of Monte
                 Carlo simulations to compare the level accuracy and power of
                 different permutation strategies in two-way ANOVA, including
                 random and mixed models, nested hierarchies and tests of
                 interaction terms. Simulation results showed that permutation
                 of residuals under a reduced model generally had greater power
                 than the exact test or alternative approximate permutation
                 methods (such as permutation of raw data). In several cases,
                 restricted permutations, in particular, suffered more than
                 other procedures, in terms of loss of power, challenging the
                 conventional wisdom of using this approach. Our simulations
                 also demonstrated that the choice of correct exchangeable
                 units under the null hypothesis, in accordance with the
                 guideline we provide, is essential for any permutation test,
                 whether it be an exact test or an approximate test. For
                 reference, we also provide appropriate permutation strategies
                 for individual terms in any two-way or three-way ANOVA for the
                 exact test (where possible) and for the approximate test using

  abstract  = "Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that
               combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with
               environmental estimates. They are used to gain ecological and
               evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across
               landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time.
               SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and
               marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines
               reflect both differences in species mobility and in ?established

               relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale,
               how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors
               is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages
               between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak,

  abstract = "Predicting the responses to natural selection is one of the key
              goals of evolutionary biology. Two of the challenges in
              fulfilling this goal have been the realization that many
              estimates of natural selection might be highly biased by
              environmentally induced covariances between traits and fitness,
              and that many estimated responses to selection do not incorporate
              or report uncertainty in the estimates. Here we describe the
              application of a framework that blends the merits of the
              Robertson-Price Identity approach and the multivariate breeder's
              equation to address these challenges. The approach allows genetic
              covariance matrices, selection differentials, selection
              gradients, and responses to selection to be estimated without
              environmentally induced bias, direct and indirect selection and
              responses to selection to be distinguished, and if implemented in
              a Bayesian-MCMC framework, statistically robust estimates of
              uncertainty on all of these parameters to be made. We illustrate
              our approach with a worked example of previously published data.
              More generally, we suggest that applying both the Robertson-Price
              Identity and the multivariate breeder's equation will facilitate
              hypothesis testing about natural selection, genetic constraints,
              and evolutionary responses.",

                 in many areas of evolutionary biology to assess the
                 significance of the association between two or more matrices
                 of distances relative to the same pairs of individuals or
                 demes. Partial Mantel tests rather than simple Mantel tests
                 are widely used to assess the relationship between two
                 variables displaying some form of structure. We show that
                 contrary to a widely shared belief, partial Mantel tests are
                 not valid in this case, and their bias remains close to that
                 of the simple Mantel test. We confirm that strong biases are
                 expected under a sampling design and spatial correlation
                 parameter drawn from an actual study. The Mantel tests should
                 not be used in case autocorrelation is suspected in both

                 for working with dissimilarities, including some not available

               combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with
               environmental estimates. They are used to gain ecological and
               evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across
               landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time.
               SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and
               marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines

               and medical communities, and in general, to researchers
               interested in applied studies. It can be suitable when the user
               is interested in the problem of constructing a discriminant rule
               on the basis of distances between a relatively small number of
               instances or units of known unbalanced-class membership measured
               on many (possibly thousands) features of any type. This is a
               current situation when analyzing genetic biomedical data. This
               discriminant rule can then be used both, as a means of
               explaining differences among classes, but also in the important
               task of assigning the class membership for new unlabeled units.
               Our package implements two discriminant analysis procedures in
               an R environment: the well-known distance-based discriminant
               analysis (DB-discriminant) and a weighteddistance-based
               discriminant (WDB-discriminant), a novel classifier rule that we
               introduce. This new procedure is based on an improvement of the
               DB rule taking into account the statistical depth of the units.
               This article presents both classifying procedures and describes
               the implementation of each in detail. We illustrate the use of
               the package using an ecological and a genetic experimental
               example. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the new

               splitting of the data, with each split defined by a simple rule
               based on environmental values. The splits are chosen to minimize

               species dissimilarity can be selected by the user, and hence MRT

               environmental data. The clusters and their dependence on the
               environmental data are represented graphically by a tree. Each
               cluster also represents a species assemblage, and its
               environmental values define its associated habitat. MRT can be

  abstract  = "The benefit of integrating batches of genomic data to increase
               statistical power is often hindered by batch effects, or
               unwanted variation in data caused by differences in technical
               factors across batches. It is therefore critical to effectively
               address batch effects in genomic data to overcome these
               challenges. Many existing methods for batch effects adjustment
               assume the data follow a continuous, bell-shaped Gaussian
               distribution. However in RNA-seq studies the data are typically
               skewed, over-dispersed counts, so this assumption is not
               appropriate and may lead to erroneous results. Negative binomial
               regression models have been used previously to better capture
               the properties of counts. We developed a batch correction
               method, ComBat-seq, using a negative binomial regression model
               that retains the integer nature of count data in RNA-seq
               studies, making the batch adjusted data compatible with common
               differential expression software packages that require integer
               counts. We show in realistic simulations that the ComBat-seq
               adjusted data results in better statistical power and control of
               false positives in differential expression compared to data
               adjusted by the other available methods. We further demonstrated
               in a real data example that ComBat-seq successfully removes
               batch effects and recovers the biological signal in the data.",

              Procrustes analysis and the Mantel test are two approaches that
              often meet this objective and are considered analogous in many
              situations especially when used as a statistical test to assess
              the statistical significance between multivariate data tables.
              Here we call the attention of ecologists to the advantages of a
              less familiar application of the Procrustean framework, namely
              the Procrustean association metric (a vector of Procrustean
              residuals). These residuals represent differences in fit between
              multivariate data tables regarding homologous observations (e.g.,
              sampling sites) that can be used to estimate local levels of
              association (e.g., some groups of sites are more similar in their
              association between biotic and environmental features than other
              groups of sites). Given that in the Mantel framework,
              multivariate information is translated into a pairwise distance
              matrix, we lose the ability to contrast homologous data points
              across dimensions and data matrices after their fit. In this
              paper, we attempt to familiarize ecologists with the benefits of
              using these Procrustean residual differences to further gain
              insights about the processes underlying the association among

  abstract  = "Abstract Mantel tests are widely used in ecology to assess the
               significance of the relationship between two distance matrices
               computed between pairs of samples. However, recent studies
               demonstrated that the presence of spatial autocorrelation in
               both distance matrices induced inflations of parameter estimates
               and type I error rates. These results also hold for partial
               Mantel test which is supposed to control for the spatial
               structures. To address the issue of spatial autocorrelation in
               testing the Mantel statistic, we developed a new procedure based
               on spatially constrained randomizations using Moran spectral
               randomization. A simulation study was conducted to assess the
               performance of this new procedure. Different scenarios were
               considered by manipulating the number of variables, the number
               of samples, the regularity of the sampling design and the level
               of spatial autocorrelation. As identified by previous studies,
               we found that Mantel statistic and its associated type I error
               rate are inflated in simple and partial Mantel tests when both
               distances matrices are spatially structured. We showed that
               these biases increased with the number of variables, decreased
               with the number of samples and were slightly lower for regular
               than irregular sampling. The new procedure succeeded in
               correcting the spurious inflations of the parameter estimates
               and type I error rates in any of the presented scenarios. Our
               results suggest that studies from several fields (e.g. genetic
               or community ecology) could have been overestimating the
               relationship between two distances matrices when both presented
               spatial autocorrelation. We proposed an alternative solution

              Accurately inferring population genetic structure requires
              whole-genome data across the geographical range of the species,
              which can be resource-intensive. A cheaper strategy is to employ
              a subset of markers that can efficiently recapitulate the
              population genetic structure inferred by the whole genome data.
              Such ancestry informative markers (AIMs), have rarely been
              developed for endangered species such as tigers utilizing single
              nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Here, we first identify the
              population structure of the Indian tiger using whole-genome
              sequences and then develop an AIMs panel with a minimum number of
              SNPs that can recapitulate this structure. We identified four
              population clusters of Indian tigers with North-East, North-West,
              and South Indian tigers forming three separate groups, and Terai
              and Central Indian tigers forming a single cluster. To evaluate
              the robustness of our AIMs, we applied it to a separate dataset
              of tigers from across India. Out of 92 SNPs present in our AIMs
              panel, 49 were present in the new dataset. These 49 SNPs were
              sufficient to recapitulate the population genetic structure
              obtained from the whole genome data. To the best of our
              knowledge, this is the first-ever SNP-based AIMs panel for big
              cats, which can be used as a cost-effective alternative to
              whole-genome sequencing for detecting the biogeographical origin

              composition and diversity of the associated insect community.
              Resistance traits of plants are likely candidates mediating
              community composition. However, it is debated whether total
              concentrations of chemical compounds or specific compounds
              determine herbivore resistance, and how chemical diversity among
              plant genotypes in turn affects the composition of the associated
              herbivore community. To study the role of specific chemical
              compounds in affecting the herbivore community, we used
              cultivated Brassica oleracea. The cultivars differ qualitatively
              in glucosinolate profile, i.e., foliar composition of different
              glucosinolate compounds, and only a little in total concentration
              of glucosinolates, the secondary metabolites specific for the
              Brassicaceae family. In field and laboratory experiments, we
              tested whether individual compounds explained differences in
              herbivore community composition, and whether herbivores with a
              similar degree of host plant specialization responded in a
              similar way to variation in glucosinolate profiles. In the field
              B. oleracea cultivars differed widely in species richness and
              composition of the herbivore community, as well as in the density
              of insects they harbored. Plants with high concentrations of the
              short side chain alkenyl glucosinolate, glucoiberin, harbored low
              herbivore diversity. Higher biodiversity was found when plants
              had glucosinolate profiles containing high concentrations of
              glucosinolates with elongated side chains, which are
              biosynthetically linked to glucoiberin. Although glucosinolates
              are known to have differential effects on generalist and
              specialist herbivores, all herbivore species exhibited similar
              responses to the intraspecific variation in foliar glucosinolate
              profiles of the B. oleracea cultivars. This observation is
              supported by the correspondence between oviposition preferences
              of the specialist herbivore Pieris rapae and the generalist
              Mamestra brassicae in the field and the laboratory, using the
              same cultivars, and may be due to the relatively low
              concentrations of glucosinolates in cultivars. Our results show
              that variation in the concentration of short side-chain
              glucosinolates affects the composition of the herbivore community
              associated with brassicaceous plants.",

                 These include restricted permutations, permutation of whole
                 groups of units, permutation of some form of residuals or some
                 combination of these. It is unclear, especially for complex
                 designs involving random factors, mixed models or nested
                 hierarchies, just which permutation strategy should be used
                 for any particular test. The purpose of this paper is
                 two-fold: (i) we provide a guideline for constructing an exact
                 permutation strategy, where possible, for any individual term
                 in any ANOVA design; and (ii) we provide results of Monte
                 Carlo simulations to compare the level accuracy and power of
                 different permutation strategies in two-way ANOVA, including
                 random and mixed models, nested hierarchies and tests of
                 interaction terms. Simulation results showed that permutation
                 of residuals under a reduced model generally had greater power
                 than the exact test or alternative approximate permutation
                 methods (such as permutation of raw data). In several cases,
                 restricted permutations, in particular, suffered more than
                 other procedures, in terms of loss of power, challenging the
                 conventional wisdom of using this approach. Our simulations

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Simpson envisaged a conceptual model of adaptive
              radiation in which lineages diversify into ``adaptive zones''
              within a macroevolutionary adaptive landscape. However, only a
              handful of studies have empirically investigated this adaptive
              landscape and its consequences for our interpretation of the
              underlying mechanisms of phenotypic evolution. In fish radiations
              the evolution of locomotor phenotypes may represent an important
              dimension of ecomorphological diversification given the
              implications of locomotion for feeding and habitat use.
              Neotropical geophagine cichlids represent a newly identified
              adaptive radiation and provide a useful system for studying
              patterns of locomotor diversification and the implications of
              selective constraints on phenotypic divergence in general.
              RESULTS: We use multivariate ordination, models of phenotypic
              evolution and posterior predictive approaches to investigate the
              macroevolutionary adaptive landscape and test for evidence of
              early divergence of locomotor phenotypes in Geophagini. The
              evolution of locomotor phenotypes was characterized by selection
              towards at least two distinct adaptive peaks and the early
              divergence of modern morphological disparity. One adaptive peak
              included the benthic and epibenthic invertivores and was
              characterized by fishes with deep, laterally compressed bodies
              that optimize precise, slow-swimming manoeuvres. The second
              adaptive peak resulted from a shift in adaptive optima in the
              species-rich ram-feeding/rheophilic Crenicichla-Teleocichla clade
              and was characterized by species with streamlined bodies that
              optimize fast starts and rapid manoeuvres. Evolutionary models
              and posterior predictive approaches favoured an early shift to a
              new adaptive peak over decreasing rates of evolution as the
              underlying process driving the early divergence of locomotor
              phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of multiple adaptive peaks
              on the divergence of locomotor phenotypes in Geophagini is
              compatible with the expectations of an ecologically driven
              adaptive radiation. This study confirms that the diversification
              of locomotor phenotypes represents an important dimension of
              phenotypic evolution in the geophagine adaptive radiation. It
              also suggests that the commonly observed early burst of
              phenotypic evolution during adaptive radiations may be better
              explained by the concentration of shifts to new adaptive peaks
              deep in the phylogeny rather than overall decreasing rates of
              evolution.",

  abstract = "Sexually selected traits show large variation and rapid evolution
              across the animal kingdom, yet genetic variation often persists
              within populations despite apparent directional selection. A key
              step in solving this long-standing paradox is to determine the
              genetic architecture of sexually selected traits to understand
              evolutionary drivers and constraints at the genomic level.
              Antlers are a form of sexual weaponry in male red deer (Cervus
              elaphus). On the island of Rum, Scotland, males with larger
              antlers have increased breeding success, yet there has been no
              evidence of any response to selection at the genetic level. To
              try and understand the mechanisms underlying this observation, we
              investigate the genetic architecture of ten antler traits and
              their principal components using genomic data from >38,000 SNPs.
              We estimate the heritabilities and genetic correlations of the
              antler traits using a genomic relatedness approach. We then use
              genome-wide association and haplotype-based regional heritability
              to identify regions of the genome underlying antler morphology,
              and an empirical Bayes approach to estimate the underlying
              distributions of allele effect sizes. We show that antler
              morphology is highly repeatable over an individual's lifetime,
              heritable and has a polygenic architecture and that almost all
              antler traits are positively genetically correlated with some
              loci identified as having pleiotropic effects. Our findings
              suggest that a large mutational target and genetic covariances
              among antler traits, in part maintained by pleiotropy, are likely
              to contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation in antler
              morphology in this population.",

              between form and function, with this hypothesis being well
              supported in restricted taxonomic and geographical contexts.
              Conversely, among broader sets of species, ecological variables
              have been shown to have limited power to explain morphological
              variation. To understand these apparent discrepancies, for a
              large and globally distributed passerine radiation, we test
              whether (a) the character states of four ecological variables
              (foraging mode, diet, strata and habitat) have different
              morphological optima, (b) ecological variables explain
              substantial variance in morphology and (c) ecological character
              states can be accurately predicted from morphology. We collected
              10 linear morphological measurements for 782 species of corvoid
              passerines, and assessed (a) the fit of models of continuous
              trait evolution with different morphological optima for each
              ecological character state, (b) variation in morphological traits
              among ecological character states using phylogenetically
              corrected regressions and (c) the accuracy of morphological
              traits in predicting species-level membership of ecological
              character states using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Models
              of morphological evolution with different ecological optima were
              well supported across numerous morphological axes, corresponding
              with significant differences in trait distributions among
              ecological character states. LDA also showed that membership of
              the ecological categories can be predicted with relatively high
              accuracy by morphology. In contrast to these findings, ecological
              variables explain limited amounts of variation in morphological
              traits. For a global radiation of passerine birds, we confirm
              that the generation of morphological variation is generally
              consistent with ecological selection pressures, but that
              ecological characters are of limited utility in explaining
              morphological differences among species. Although selection
              towards different optima means that membership of ecological
              character states tend to be well predicted by morphology, the
              overall morphospace of individual ecological character states
              tend to be broad, implying that morphology can evolve in multiple
              ways in response to similar selection pressures. Extensive
              variation in morphological adaptations among similar ecological
              strategies is likely to be a widespread phenomenon across the

              Ligia occidentalis sensu lato, a rocky supralittoral isopod
              distributed along a ~3000 km latitudinal gradient that
              encompasses several proposed marine biogeographic provinces and
              ecoregions in the eastern Pacific. Highly divergent lineages have
              nonoverlapping geographic distributions, with distributional
              limits that generally correspond with sharp environmental
              changes. Crossbreeding experiments suggest postmating
              reproductive barriers exist among some of them, and surveys of
              mitochondrial and nuclear gene markers do not show evidence of
              hybridization. Populations are highly isolated, some of which
              appear to be very small; thus, the effects of drift are expected
              to reduce the efficiency of selection. Large genetic divergences
              among lineages, marked environmental differences in their ranges,
              reproductive isolation, and/or high isolation of populations may
              have resulted in morphological differences in L. occidentalis,
              not detected yet by traditional taxonomy. We used landmark-based
              geometric morphometric analyses to test for differences in body
              shape among highly divergent lineages of L. occidentalis, and
              among populations within these lineages. We analyzed a total of
              492 individuals from 53 coastal localities from the southern
              California Bight to Central Mexico, including the Gulf of
              California. We conducted discriminant function analyses (DFAs) on
              body shape morphometrics to assess morphological variation among
              genetically differentiated lineages and their populations. We
              also tested for associations between phylogeny and morphological
              variation, and whether genetic divergence is correlated to
              multivariate morphological divergence. We detected significant
              differences in body shape among highly divergent lineages, and
              among populations within these lineages. Nonetheless, neither
              lineages nor populations can be discriminated on the basis of
              body shape, because correct classification rates of
              cross-validated DFAs were low. Genetic distance and phylogeny had
              weak to no effect on body shape variation. The supralittoral
              environment appears to exert strong stabilizing selection and/or
              strong functional constraints on body shape in L. occidentalis,

              abundance, and species diversity indices, have been developed to
              capture the state of ecological communities over space and time.
              As biodiversity is a multifaceted concept, it is important to
              understand the dimension of biodiversity reflected by each
              indicator for successful conservation and management. Here we
              utilized the responsiveness of biodiversity indicators' dynamics
              to environmental changes (i.e., environmental responsiveness) as
              a signature of the dimension of biodiversity. We present a method
              for characterizing and classifying biodiversity indicators
              according to environmental responsiveness and apply the
              methodology to monitoring data for a marine fish community under
              intermittent anthropogenic warm water discharge. Our analysis
              showed that 10 biodiversity indicators can be classified into
              three super-groups based on the dimension of biodiversity that is
              reflected. Group I (species richness and community mean of
              latitudinal center of distribution (cCOD)) showed the greatest
              robustness to temperature changes; Group II (species diversity
              and total abundance) showed an abrupt change in the middle of the
              monitoring period, presumably due to a change in temperature;
              Group III (species evenness) exhibited the highest sensitivity to
              environmental changes, including temperature. These results had
              several ecological implications. First, the responsiveness of
              species diversity and species evenness to temperature changes
              might be related to changes in the species abundance
              distribution. Second, the similar environmental responsiveness of
              species richness and cCOD implies that fish migration from lower
              latitudes is a major driver of species compositional changes. The
              study methodology may be useful in selecting appropriate
              indicators for efficient biodiversity monitoring.",

  abstract = "To study the evolution of several quantitative traits, the
              classical phylogenetic comparative framework consists of a
              multivariate random process running along the branches of a
              phylogenetic tree. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process is
              sometimes preferred to the simple Brownian motion (BM) as it
              models stabilizing selection toward an optimum. The optimum for
              each trait is likely to be changing over the long periods of time
              spanned by large modern phylogenies. Our goal is to automatically
              detect the position of these shifts on a phylogenetic tree, while
              accounting for correlations between traits, which might exist
              because of structural or evolutionary constraints. We show that,
              in the presence of shifts, phylogenetic Principal Component
              Analysis fails to decorrelate traits efficiently, so that any
              method aiming at finding shifts needs to deal with correlation
              simultaneously. We introduce here a simplification of the full
              multivariate OU model, named scalar OU, which allows for
              noncausal correlations and is still computationally tractable. We
              extend the equivalence between the OU and a BM on a rescaled tree
              to our multivariate framework. We describe an
              Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that allows for a maximum
              likelihood estimation of the shift positions, associated with a
              new model selection criterion, accounting for the identifiability
              issues for the shift localization on the tree. The method, freely
              available as an R-package (PhylogeneticEM) is fast, and can deal
              with missing values. We demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy
              compared to another state-of-the-art method ($\ell$1ou) on a wide
              range of simulated scenarios and use this new framework to

              tolerate the novel environmental conditions associated with urban
              areas. Studies of adaptive divergence in urban areas often
              examine one or a few traits at a time from populations residing
              only at the most extreme urban and nonurban habitats. Thus,
              whether urbanization drives divergence in many traits

  author    = "Greenacre, Michael",
  abstract  = "Summary Ordination and clustering methods are widely applied to
               ecological data that are non‐negative, for example, species
               abundances or biomasses. These methods rely on a measure of
               multivariate proximity that quantifies differences between the
               sampling units (e.g. individuals, stations, time points),
               leading to results such as: (i) ordinations of the units, where
               interpoint distances optimally display the measured differences;
               (ii) clustering the units into homogeneous clusters or (iii)
               assessing differences between pre‐specified groups of units
               (e.g. regions, periods, treatment–control groups). These methods
               all conceal a fundamental question: To what extent are the
               differences between the sampling units, computed according to
               the chosen proximity function, capturing the `size' in the
               multivariate observations, or their `shape'? `Size' means the
               overall level of the measurements: for example, some samples
               contain higher total abundances or more biomass, others less.
               `Shape' means the relative levels of the measurements: for
               example, some samples have different relative abundances, i.e.
               different compositions. To answer this question, several
               well‐known proximity measures are considered and applied to two
               datasets, one of which is used in a simulation exercise where
               `shape' differences have been eliminated by randomization. For
               any dataset and any proximity measure, a quantification is
               achieved of the proportion of `size' variance and `shape'
               variance that the measure is capturing, as well as the
               proportion of variance that confounds `size' and `shape'
               together. The results consistently show that the Bray–Curtis
               coefficient incorporates both `size' and `shape' differences, to
               varying degrees. These two components are thus always confounded
               by this proximity measure in the determination of ordinations,
               clusters, group comparisons and relations to environmental
               variables. There are several implications of these results, the
               main one being that researchers should be aware of this issue
               when they choose a proximity measure. They should compute the
               `size' and `shape' components for their particular datasets, as
               this can radically affect the interpretation of their results.
               It is recommended to separate these components: analysing total
               abundances or other measures of `size' by univariate methods,
               and using multivariate analysis on the relative abundances where
               size has been specifically excluded.",

               is a group of ten tropical species from sub-Saharan Africa and

               characterised by a capitate head of whiteyellow spikelets and
               modified culm bases and recent molecular analysis puts them in a
               distinct clade. The group lacks a modern taxonomic revision, and
               the taxa described in the Flora treatments of the past 50 years
               differ considerably in their circumscription. In this study,
               morphometric analyses are used to test species limits to
               establish more stable morphological delimitations of the taxa.
               Material and methods – An examination of 15 morphological
               characters on 489 herbarium specimens was carried out and the
               data was analysed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
               Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with cross-validation, and
               Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis. Cyperus
               kibweanus was not further considered due to lack of material.
               Key results – Both PCA and LDA showed varying degrees of overlap
               in the nine remaining taxa, with no single group clearly
               separating in multivariate space. However, cross-validation
               clearly showed C. margaritaceus as a distinct entity despite its
               overwhelming presence in the PCA. Both LDA and CART failed to
               separate C. niveus as a distinct group as its specimens were
               dispersed among the other groups. Differing results were
               obtained for other taxa depending on the type of analysis.
               Cyperus margaritaceus, C. nduru, and C. sphaerocephalus were
               divided into two groups by CART but re-examination of the
               specimens does not definitively support the idea that these
               infraspecific groups represent separate taxa. Conclusions – The
               results show that eight morphospecies are recognised by LDA and
               six morphospecies by CART. Characters used to separate the taxa
               in Flora treatments scored high loadings in the analysis showing
               their high taxonomic utility value. The methods used can be
               applied to resolving other complexes in the Cyperaceae.]",

               include restricted permutations, permutation of whole groups of
               units, permutation of some form of residuals or some combination
               of these. It is unclear, especially for complex designs
               involving random factors, mixed models or nested hierarchies,
               just which permutation strategy should be used for any
               particular test. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (i) we
               provide a guideline for constructing an exact permutation
               strategy, where possible, for any individual term in any ANOVA
               design; and (ii) we provide results of Monte Carlo simulations

               strategies in two-way ANOVA, including random and mixed models,
               nested hierarchies and tests of interaction terms. Simulation
               results showed that permutation of residuals under a reduced
               model generally had greater power than the exact test or
               alternative approximate permutation methods (such as permutation
               of raw data). In several cases, restricted permutations, in
               particular, suffered more than other procedures, in terms of
               loss of power, challenging the conventional wisdom of using this
               approach. Our simulations also demonstrated that the choice of
               correct exchangeable units under the null hypothesis, in
               accordance with the guideline we provide, is essential for any
               permutation test, whether it be an exact test or an approximate

               strategies for individual terms in any two-way or three-way

  abstract  = "AbstractHypothesis‐testing methods for multivariate data are
               needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects
               of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of
               variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate
               data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too
               stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate
               data sets. Non‐parametric methods, based on permutation tests,
               are preferable. This paper describes a new non‐parametric method
               for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and
               Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications
               in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive
               formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to
               complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in
               press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an
               improvement on previous non‐parametric methods because it allows
               a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models.
               It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of
               formal assumptions of other non‐parametric methods. The
               test‐statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F‐ratio
               and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or
               dissimilarity matrix. P‐values are then obtained using
               permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests

  abstract  = "[Niche segregation of American lobster Homarus americanus and
               rock crab Cancer irroratus was investigated in the southern Gulf
               of St Lawrence using density, biomass, size structure and diet
               of these 2 species captured in 4 habitats. Rocky bottoms
               colonized with macroalgae supported the highest density and
               biomass of both species, but they also coexisted in lesser
               numbers on bare rocky bottoms. Low densities of crabs of all
               sizes and of large lobsters were found on eelgrass beds, and
               crabs only on bare sand. The proportions of size groups of
               lobsters and crabs differed significantly among substrate types.
               Small lobsters and large crabs predominated on bare rocky
               bottoms, while large lobsters and small crabs were mostly found
               between boulders with macroalgae. Examination of stomach
               contents of lobsters and crabs coexisting on rocky bottoms with
               and without algae showed the lobsters' diet to remain similar at
               both sites, while that of crabs differed between sites. Diets of
               small lobsters and small crabs were more similar than those of
               larger individuals, possibly because small individuals of both
               species remain hidden in sediment and crevices between stones.
               Lobsters fed principally on horse mussels, rock crabs, lobsters,
               gastropods and ectoprocts, while rock crabs fed on horse
               mussels, ectoprocts and polychaetes. Large crabs occasionally
               preyed upon small lobsters. At both rocky sites and for all size
               groups, crab diet always exhibited a lower average calorific
               value than that of lobster. In the bare stone habitat,
               supporting low densities of large lobsters, the average
               calorific value for large rock crab diet was consistently higher
               than in the large rocks with algae habitat, supporting a high
               density of large lobsters. While lobster diet remained similar
               between sites, rock crab diet was poorest on grounds where large
               lobsters occurred, possibly reflecting increased risk due to
               predation while foraging for food. The coexistence of American
               lobster and rock crab is made possible by their different use of
               the substrate and food resources with increasing size, and by
               the flexibility of the rock crab.]",

  abstract = "Land-use change is one of the most important drivers of
              widespread declines in pollinator populations. Comprehensive
              quantitative methods for land classification are critical to
              understanding these effects, but co-option of existing
              human-focussed land classifications is often inappropriate for
              pollinator research. Here, we present a flexible GIS-based land
              classification protocol for pollinator research using a bottom-up
              approach driven by reference to pollinator ecology, with
              urbanization as a case study. Our multistep method involves
              manually generating land cover maps at multiple biologically
              relevant radii surrounding study sites using GIS, with a focus on
              identifying land cover types that have a specific relevance to
              pollinators. This is followed by a three-step refinement process
              using statistical tools: (i) definition of land-use categories,
              (ii) principal components analysis on the categories, and (iii)
              cluster analysis to generate a categorical land-use variable for
              use in subsequent analysis. Model selection is then used to
              determine the appropriate spatial scale for analysis. We
              demonstrate an application of our protocol using a case study of
              38 sites across a gradient of urbanization in South-East England.
              In our case study, the land classification generated a
              categorical land-use variable at each of four radii based on the
              clustering of sites with different degrees of urbanization, open
              land, and flower-rich habitat. Studies of land-use effects on
              pollinators have historically employed a wide array of land
              classification techniques from descriptive and qualitative to
              complex and quantitative. We suggest that land-use studies in
              pollinator ecology should broadly adopt GIS-based multistep land
              classification techniques to enable robust analysis and aid
              comparative research. Our protocol offers a customizable approach
              that combines specific relevance to pollinator research with the
              potential for application to a wide range of ecological

  title    = "Clines Arc through Multivariate Morphospace",
  author   = "Lohman, Brian K and Berner, Daniel and Bolnick, Daniel I",
  abstract = "Evolutionary biologists typically represent clines as spatial
              gradients in a univariate character (or a principal-component
              axis) whose mean changes as a function of location along a
              transect spanning an environmental gradient or ecotone. This
              univariate approach may obscure the multivariate nature of
              phenotypic evolution across a landscape. Clines might instead be
              plotted as a series of vectors in multidimensional morphospace,
              connecting sequential geographic sites. We present a model
              showing that clines may trace nonlinear paths that arc through
              morphospace rather than elongating along a single major
              trajectory. Arcing clines arise because different characters
              diverge at different rates or locations along a geographic
              transect. We empirically confirm that some clines arc through
              morphospace, using morphological data from threespine stickleback
              sampled along eight independent transects from lakes down their
              respective outlet streams. In all eight clines, successive
              vectors of lake-stream divergence fluctuate in direction and
              magnitude in trait space, rather than pointing along a single
              phenotypic axis. Most clines exhibit surprisingly irregular
              directions of divergence as one moves downstream, although a few
              clines exhibit more directional arcs through morphospace. Our
              results highlight the multivariate complexity of clines that
              cannot be captured with the traditional graphical framework. We

  author      = "Harrell, Frank E",
  abstract    = "Many texts are excellent sources of knowledge about individual
                 statistical tools, but the art of data analysis is about
                 choosing and using multiple tools. Instead of presenting
                 isolated techniques, this text emphasizes problem solving
                 strategies that address the many issues arising when
                 developing multivariable models using real data and not
                 standard textbook examples. It includes imputation methods for
                 dealing with missing data effectively, methods for dealing
                 with nonlinear relationships and for making the estimation of
                 transformations a formal part of the modeling process, methods
                 for dealing with ``too many variables to analyze and not
                 enough observations,'' and powerful model validation
                 techniques based on the bootstrap. This text realistically
                 deals with model uncertainty and its effects on inference to
                 achieve ``safe data mining''.",

  title     = "Multivariate Statistics for Wildlife and Ecology Research",
  author    = "McGarigal, Kevin and Cushman, Samuel A and Stafford, Susan",
  abstract  = "Wildlife researchers and ecologists make widespread use of
               multivariate statistics in their studies. With its focus on the
               practical application of the techniques of multivariate
               statistics, this book shapes the powerful tools of statistics
               for the specific needs of ecologists and makes statistics more
               applicable to their course of study. Multivariate Statistics for
               Wildlife and Ecology Research gives the reader a solid
               conceptual understanding of the role of multivariate statistics
               in ecological applications and the relationships among various
               techniques, while avoiding detailed mathematics and underlying
               theory. More important, the reader will gain insight into the
               type of research questions best handled by each technique and
               the important considerations in applying each one. Whether used
               as a textbook for specialized courses or as a supplement to
               general statistics texts, the book emphasizes those techniques
               that students of ecology and natural resources most need to
               understand and employ in their research. Detailed examples use
               real wildlife data sets analyzed using the SAS statistical
               software program. The book is specifically targeted for
               upper-division and graduate students in wildlife biology,
               forestry, and ecology, and for professional wildlife scientists
               and natural resource managers, but it will be valuable to
               researchers in any of the biological sciences.",

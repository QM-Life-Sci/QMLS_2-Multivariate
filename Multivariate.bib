                 statistical tools, but the art of data analysis is about
                 choosing and using multiple tools. Instead of presenting
                 isolated techniques, this text emphasizes problem solving
                 strategies that address the many issues arising when
                 developing multivariable models using real data and not
                 standard textbook examples. It includes imputation methods for
                 dealing with missing data effectively, methods for dealing
                 with nonlinear relationships and for making the estimation of
                 transformations a formal part of the modeling process, methods
                 for dealing with ``too many variables to analyze and not

  abstract  = "Wildlife researchers and ecologists make widespread use of
               multivariate statistics in their studies. With its focus on the
               practical application of the techniques of multivariate
               statistics, this book shapes the powerful tools of statistics
               for the specific needs of ecologists and makes statistics more
               applicable to their course of study. Multivariate Statistics for
               Wildlife and Ecology Research gives the reader a solid
               conceptual understanding of the role of multivariate statistics
               in ecological applications and the relationships among various
               techniques, while avoiding detailed mathematics and underlying
               theory. More important, the reader will gain insight into the
               type of research questions best handled by each technique and
               the important considerations in applying each one. Whether used
               as a textbook for specialized courses or as a supplement to
               general statistics texts, the book emphasizes those techniques
               that students of ecology and natural resources most need to
               understand and employ in their research. Detailed examples use
               real wildlife data sets analyzed using the SAS statistical
               software program. The book is specifically targeted for
               upper-division and graduate students in wildlife biology,
               forestry, and ecology, and for professional wildlife scientists
               and natural resource managers, but it will be valuable to
               researchers in any of the biological sciences.",

                 space explicitly is an extremely flexible tool for answering
                 these questions. The R package ecodist brings together methods
                 for working with dissimilarities, including some not available
                 in other R packages. We present some of the features of
                 ecodist, particularly simple and partial Mantel tests, and
                 make recommendations for their effective use. Although the
                 partial Mantel test is often used to account for the effects
                 of space, the assumption of linearity greatly reduces its
                 effectiveness for complex spatial patterns. We introduce a
                 modification of the Mantel correlogram designed to overcome
                 this restriction and allow consideration of complex nonlinear
                 structures. This extension of the method allows the use of
                 partial multivariate correlograms and tests of relationship
                 between variables at different spatial scales. Some of the

              Procrustes analysis and the Mantel test are two approaches that
              often meet this objective and are considered analogous in many
              situations especially when used as a statistical test to assess
              the statistical significance between multivariate data tables.
              Here we call the attention of ecologists to the advantages of a
              less familiar application of the Procrustean framework, namely
              the Procrustean association metric (a vector of Procrustean
              residuals). These residuals represent differences in fit between
              multivariate data tables regarding homologous observations (e.g.,
              sampling sites) that can be used to estimate local levels of
              association (e.g., some groups of sites are more similar in their
              association between biotic and environmental features than other
              groups of sites). Given that in the Mantel framework,
              multivariate information is translated into a pairwise distance
              matrix, we lose the ability to contrast homologous data points
              across dimensions and data matrices after their fit. In this
              paper, we attempt to familiarize ecologists with the benefits of
              using these Procrustean residual differences to further gain
              insights about the processes underlying the association among
              multivariate data tables using real and hypothetical examples.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Mantel tests are widely used in ecology to assess the
               significance of the relationship between two distance matrices
               computed between pairs of samples. However, recent studies
               demonstrated that the presence of spatial autocorrelation in
               both distance matrices induced inflations of parameter estimates
               and type I error rates. These results also hold for partial
               Mantel test which is supposed to control for the spatial
               structures. To address the issue of spatial autocorrelation in
               testing the Mantel statistic, we developed a new procedure based
               on spatially constrained randomizations using Moran spectral
               randomization. A simulation study was conducted to assess the
               performance of this new procedure. Different scenarios were
               considered by manipulating the number of variables, the number
               of samples, the regularity of the sampling design and the level
               of spatial autocorrelation. As identified by previous studies,
               we found that Mantel statistic and its associated type I error
               rate are inflated in simple and partial Mantel tests when both
               distances matrices are spatially structured. We showed that
               these biases increased with the number of variables, decreased
               with the number of samples and were slightly lower for regular
               than irregular sampling. The new procedure succeeded in
               correcting the spurious inflations of the parameter estimates
               and type I error rates in any of the presented scenarios. Our
               results suggest that studies from several fields (e.g. genetic
               or community ecology) could have been overestimating the
               relationship between two distances matrices when both presented
               spatial autocorrelation. We proposed an alternative solution
               applicable in every field to correctly compute Mantel statistic

  abstract = "Land-use change is one of the most important drivers of
              widespread declines in pollinator populations. Comprehensive
              quantitative methods for land classification are critical to
              understanding these effects, but co-option of existing
              human-focussed land classifications is often inappropriate for
              pollinator research. Here, we present a flexible GIS-based land
              classification protocol for pollinator research using a bottom-up
              approach driven by reference to pollinator ecology, with
              urbanization as a case study. Our multistep method involves
              manually generating land cover maps at multiple biologically
              relevant radii surrounding study sites using GIS, with a focus on
              identifying land cover types that have a specific relevance to
              pollinators. This is followed by a three-step refinement process
              using statistical tools: (i) definition of land-use categories,
              (ii) principal components analysis on the categories, and (iii)
              cluster analysis to generate a categorical land-use variable for
              use in subsequent analysis. Model selection is then used to
              determine the appropriate spatial scale for analysis. We
              demonstrate an application of our protocol using a case study of
              38 sites across a gradient of urbanization in South-East England.
              In our case study, the land classification generated a
              categorical land-use variable at each of four radii based on the
              clustering of sites with different degrees of urbanization, open
              land, and flower-rich habitat. Studies of land-use effects on
              pollinators have historically employed a wide array of land
              classification techniques from descriptive and qualitative to
              complex and quantitative. We suggest that land-use studies in
              pollinator ecology should broadly adopt GIS-based multistep land
              classification techniques to enable robust analysis and aid
              comparative research. Our protocol offers a customizable approach
              that combines specific relevance to pollinator research with the

              questions, including agroecological studies of pest control.",

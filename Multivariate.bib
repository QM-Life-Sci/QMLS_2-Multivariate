                 strategies that address the many issues arising when
                 developing multivariable models using real data and not

               practical application of the techniques of multivariate
               statistics, this book shapes the powerful tools of statistics
               for the specific needs of ecologists and makes statistics more
               applicable to their course of study. Multivariate Statistics for
               Wildlife and Ecology Research gives the reader a solid
               conceptual understanding of the role of multivariate statistics
               in ecological applications and the relationships among various
               techniques, while avoiding detailed mathematics and underlying
               theory. More important, the reader will gain insight into the
               type of research questions best handled by each technique and
               the important considerations in applying each one. Whether used
               as a textbook for specialized courses or as a supplement to
               general statistics texts, the book emphasizes those techniques
               that students of ecology and natural resources most need to
               understand and employ in their research. Detailed examples use
               real wildlife data sets analyzed using the SAS statistical
               software program. The book is specifically targeted for
               upper-division and graduate students in wildlife biology,
               forestry, and ecology, and for professional wildlife scientists
               and natural resource managers, but it will be valuable to

              southern Oregon and northern California, USA, differ
              substantially from the predictions of these general scaling

              observed foliar nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations

              Darlingtonia were strongly correlated with elevation and differed
              with soil calcium availability and bedrock type. The mean foliar
              N : P of 25.2 ± 15.4 of Darlingtonia suggested that these plants

              response to N limitation, but for Darlingtonia, carnivory is an

  title    = "A land classification protocol for pollinator ecology research:
              An urbanization case study",
  author   = "Samuelson, Ash E and Leadbeater, Ellouise",
  abstract = "Land-use change is one of the most important drivers of
              widespread declines in pollinator populations. Comprehensive
              quantitative methods for land classification are critical to
              understanding these effects, but co-option of existing
              human-focussed land classifications is often inappropriate for
              pollinator research. Here, we present a flexible GIS-based land
              classification protocol for pollinator research using a bottom-up
              approach driven by reference to pollinator ecology, with
              urbanization as a case study. Our multistep method involves
              manually generating land cover maps at multiple biologically
              relevant radii surrounding study sites using GIS, with a focus on
              identifying land cover types that have a specific relevance to
              pollinators. This is followed by a three-step refinement process
              using statistical tools: (i) definition of land-use categories,
              (ii) principal components analysis on the categories, and (iii)
              cluster analysis to generate a categorical land-use variable for
              use in subsequent analysis. Model selection is then used to
              determine the appropriate spatial scale for analysis. We
              demonstrate an application of our protocol using a case study of
              38 sites across a gradient of urbanization in South-East England.
              In our case study, the land classification generated a
              categorical land-use variable at each of four radii based on the
              clustering of sites with different degrees of urbanization, open
              land, and flower-rich habitat. Studies of land-use effects on
              pollinators have historically employed a wide array of land
              classification techniques from descriptive and qualitative to
              complex and quantitative. We suggest that land-use studies in
              pollinator ecology should broadly adopt GIS-based multistep land
              classification techniques to enable robust analysis and aid
              comparative research. Our protocol offers a customizable approach
              that combines specific relevance to pollinator research with the
              potential for application to a wide range of ecological
              questions, including agroecological studies of pest control.",

               (PERMANOVA) is a geometric partitioning of variation across a

               chosen dissimilarity measure, in response to one or more factors
               in an analysis of variance design. Statistical inferences are
               made in a distribution-free setting using permutational

               accommodate random effects, hierarchical models, mixed models,
               quantitative covariates, repeated measures, unbalanced and/or
               asymmetrical designs, and, most recently, heterogeneous

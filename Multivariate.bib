               practical application of the techniques of multivariate
               statistics, this book shapes the powerful tools of statistics
               for the specific needs of ecologists and makes statistics more
               applicable to their course of study. Multivariate Statistics for
               Wildlife and Ecology Research gives the reader a solid
               conceptual understanding of the role of multivariate statistics
               in ecological applications and the relationships among various
               techniques, while avoiding detailed mathematics and underlying
               theory. More important, the reader will gain insight into the
               type of research questions best handled by each technique and
               the important considerations in applying each one. Whether used
               as a textbook for specialized courses or as a supplement to
               general statistics texts, the book emphasizes those techniques
               that students of ecology and natural resources most need to
               understand and employ in their research. Detailed examples use
               real wildlife data sets analyzed using the SAS statistical
               software program. The book is specifically targeted for
               upper-division and graduate students in wildlife biology,
               forestry, and ecology, and for professional wildlife scientists
               and natural resource managers, but it will be valuable to

                 are widely used to assess the relationship between two

                 contrary to a widely shared belief, partial Mantel tests are
                 not valid in this case, and their bias remains close to that
                 of the simple Mantel test. We confirm that strong biases are
                 expected under a sampling design and spatial correlation
                 parameter drawn from an actual study. The Mantel tests should
                 not be used in case autocorrelation is suspected in both

                 for working with dissimilarities, including some not available

               statistical power is often hindered by batch effects, or
               unwanted variation in data caused by differences in technical
               factors across batches. It is therefore critical to effectively
               address batch effects in genomic data to overcome these
               challenges. Many existing methods for batch effects adjustment
               assume the data follow a continuous, bell-shaped Gaussian
               distribution. However in RNA-seq studies the data are typically
               skewed, over-dispersed counts, so this assumption is not
               appropriate and may lead to erroneous results. Negative binomial
               regression models have been used previously to better capture
               the properties of counts. We developed a batch correction
               method, ComBat-seq, using a negative binomial regression model
               that retains the integer nature of count data in RNA-seq
               studies, making the batch adjusted data compatible with common
               differential expression software packages that require integer
               counts. We show in realistic simulations that the ComBat-seq
               adjusted data results in better statistical power and control of
               false positives in differential expression compared to data
               adjusted by the other available methods. We further demonstrated

              Here we call the attention of ecologists to the advantages of a

              the Procrustean association metric (a vector of Procrustean

              multivariate data tables regarding homologous observations (e.g.,
              sampling sites) that can be used to estimate local levels of

              association between biotic and environmental features than other
              groups of sites). Given that in the Mantel framework,

  abstract  = "Abstract Mantel tests are widely used in ecology to assess the
               significance of the relationship between two distance matrices
               computed between pairs of samples. However, recent studies
               demonstrated that the presence of spatial autocorrelation in
               both distance matrices induced inflations of parameter estimates
               and type I error rates. These results also hold for partial
               Mantel test which is supposed to control for the spatial
               structures. To address the issue of spatial autocorrelation in
               testing the Mantel statistic, we developed a new procedure based
               on spatially constrained randomizations using Moran spectral
               randomization. A simulation study was conducted to assess the
               performance of this new procedure. Different scenarios were
               considered by manipulating the number of variables, the number
               of samples, the regularity of the sampling design and the level
               of spatial autocorrelation. As identified by previous studies,
               we found that Mantel statistic and its associated type I error
               rate are inflated in simple and partial Mantel tests when both
               distances matrices are spatially structured. We showed that
               these biases increased with the number of variables, decreased
               with the number of samples and were slightly lower for regular
               than irregular sampling. The new procedure succeeded in
               correcting the spurious inflations of the parameter estimates
               and type I error rates in any of the presented scenarios. Our
               results suggest that studies from several fields (e.g. genetic
               or community ecology) could have been overestimating the
               relationship between two distances matrices when both presented

              and South Indian tigers forming three separate groups, and Terai
              and Central Indian tigers forming a single cluster. To evaluate
              the robustness of our AIMs, we applied it to a separate dataset
              of tigers from across India. Out of 92 SNPs present in our AIMs

  abstract = "Intraspecific variation in plants plays a major role in the
              composition and diversity of the associated insect community.
              Resistance traits of plants are likely candidates mediating
              community composition. However, it is debated whether total
              concentrations of chemical compounds or specific compounds
              determine herbivore resistance, and how chemical diversity among
              plant genotypes in turn affects the composition of the associated
              herbivore community. To study the role of specific chemical
              compounds in affecting the herbivore community, we used
              cultivated Brassica oleracea. The cultivars differ qualitatively
              in glucosinolate profile, i.e., foliar composition of different
              glucosinolate compounds, and only a little in total concentration
              of glucosinolates, the secondary metabolites specific for the
              Brassicaceae family. In field and laboratory experiments, we
              tested whether individual compounds explained differences in
              herbivore community composition, and whether herbivores with a
              similar degree of host plant specialization responded in a
              similar way to variation in glucosinolate profiles. In the field
              B. oleracea cultivars differed widely in species richness and
              composition of the herbivore community, as well as in the density
              of insects they harbored. Plants with high concentrations of the
              short side chain alkenyl glucosinolate, glucoiberin, harbored low
              herbivore diversity. Higher biodiversity was found when plants
              had glucosinolate profiles containing high concentrations of
              glucosinolates with elongated side chains, which are
              biosynthetically linked to glucoiberin. Although glucosinolates
              are known to have differential effects on generalist and
              specialist herbivores, all herbivore species exhibited similar
              responses to the intraspecific variation in foliar glucosinolate
              profiles of the B. oleracea cultivars. This observation is
              supported by the correspondence between oviposition preferences
              of the specialist herbivore Pieris rapae and the generalist
              Mamestra brassicae in the field and the laboratory, using the
              same cultivars, and may be due to the relatively low
              concentrations of glucosinolates in cultivars. Our results show
              that variation in the concentration of short side-chain
              glucosinolates affects the composition of the herbivore community
              associated with brassicaceous plants.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Simpson envisaged a conceptual model of adaptive
              radiation in which lineages diversify into ``adaptive zones''
              within a macroevolutionary adaptive landscape. However, only a
              handful of studies have empirically investigated this adaptive
              landscape and its consequences for our interpretation of the
              underlying mechanisms of phenotypic evolution. In fish radiations
              the evolution of locomotor phenotypes may represent an important
              dimension of ecomorphological diversification given the
              implications of locomotion for feeding and habitat use.
              Neotropical geophagine cichlids represent a newly identified
              adaptive radiation and provide a useful system for studying
              patterns of locomotor diversification and the implications of
              selective constraints on phenotypic divergence in general.
              RESULTS: We use multivariate ordination, models of phenotypic
              evolution and posterior predictive approaches to investigate the
              macroevolutionary adaptive landscape and test for evidence of
              early divergence of locomotor phenotypes in Geophagini. The
              evolution of locomotor phenotypes was characterized by selection
              towards at least two distinct adaptive peaks and the early
              divergence of modern morphological disparity. One adaptive peak
              included the benthic and epibenthic invertivores and was
              characterized by fishes with deep, laterally compressed bodies
              that optimize precise, slow-swimming manoeuvres. The second
              adaptive peak resulted from a shift in adaptive optima in the
              species-rich ram-feeding/rheophilic Crenicichla-Teleocichla clade
              and was characterized by species with streamlined bodies that
              optimize fast starts and rapid manoeuvres. Evolutionary models
              and posterior predictive approaches favoured an early shift to a
              new adaptive peak over decreasing rates of evolution as the
              underlying process driving the early divergence of locomotor
              phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of multiple adaptive peaks
              on the divergence of locomotor phenotypes in Geophagini is
              compatible with the expectations of an ecologically driven
              adaptive radiation. This study confirms that the diversification
              of locomotor phenotypes represents an important dimension of
              phenotypic evolution in the geophagine adaptive radiation. It
              also suggests that the commonly observed early burst of
              phenotypic evolution during adaptive radiations may be better
              explained by the concentration of shifts to new adaptive peaks
              deep in the phylogeny rather than overall decreasing rates of
              evolution.",

              step in solving this long-standing paradox is to determine the
              genetic architecture of sexually selected traits to understand
              evolutionary drivers and constraints at the genomic level.
              Antlers are a form of sexual weaponry in male red deer (Cervus
              elaphus). On the island of Rum, Scotland, males with larger
              antlers have increased breeding success, yet there has been no
              evidence of any response to selection at the genetic level. To
              try and understand the mechanisms underlying this observation, we
              investigate the genetic architecture of ten antler traits and
              their principal components using genomic data from >38,000 SNPs.
              We estimate the heritabilities and genetic correlations of the
              antler traits using a genomic relatedness approach. We then use
              genome-wide association and haplotype-based regional heritability
              to identify regions of the genome underlying antler morphology,
              and an empirical Bayes approach to estimate the underlying

              morphology is highly repeatable over an individual's lifetime,
              heritable and has a polygenic architecture and that almost all
              antler traits are positively genetically correlated with some
              loci identified as having pleiotropic effects. Our findings
              suggest that a large mutational target and genetic covariances
              among antler traits, in part maintained by pleiotropy, are likely
              to contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation in antler

               presence of spatial autocorrelation in the data: univariate
               methods (all-directional and two-dimensional spatial
               correlograms, and two-dimensional spectral analysis), and the
               multivariate Mantel test and Mantel correlogram; other
               descriptive methods of spatial structure: the univariate
               variogram, and the multivariate methods of clustering with
               spatial contiguity constraint; the partial Mantel test,
               presented here as a way of studying causal models that include
               space as an explanatory variable; and finally, various methods
               for mapping ecological variables and producing either univariate
               maps (interpolation, trend surface analysis, kriging) or maps of
               truly multivariate data (produced by constrained clustering). A

  author    = "Hudon, Christiane and Lamarche, Gabriel",
  abstract  = "[Niche segregation of American lobster Homarus americanus and
               rock crab Cancer irroratus was investigated in the southern Gulf
               of St Lawrence using density, biomass, size structure and diet
               of these 2 species captured in 4 habitats. Rocky bottoms
               colonized with macroalgae supported the highest density and
               biomass of both species, but they also coexisted in lesser
               numbers on bare rocky bottoms. Low densities of crabs of all
               sizes and of large lobsters were found on eelgrass beds, and
               crabs only on bare sand. The proportions of size groups of
               lobsters and crabs differed significantly among substrate types.
               Small lobsters and large crabs predominated on bare rocky
               bottoms, while large lobsters and small crabs were mostly found
               between boulders with macroalgae. Examination of stomach
               contents of lobsters and crabs coexisting on rocky bottoms with
               and without algae showed the lobsters' diet to remain similar at
               both sites, while that of crabs differed between sites. Diets of
               small lobsters and small crabs were more similar than those of
               larger individuals, possibly because small individuals of both
               species remain hidden in sediment and crevices between stones.
               Lobsters fed principally on horse mussels, rock crabs, lobsters,
               gastropods and ectoprocts, while rock crabs fed on horse
               mussels, ectoprocts and polychaetes. Large crabs occasionally
               preyed upon small lobsters. At both rocky sites and for all size
               groups, crab diet always exhibited a lower average calorific
               value than that of lobster. In the bare stone habitat,
               supporting low densities of large lobsters, the average
               calorific value for large rock crab diet was consistently higher
               than in the large rocks with algae habitat, supporting a high
               density of large lobsters. While lobster diet remained similar
               between sites, rock crab diet was poorest on grounds where large
               lobsters occurred, possibly reflecting increased risk due to
               predation while foraging for food. The coexistence of American
               lobster and rock crab is made possible by their different use of
               the substrate and food resources with increasing size, and by
               the flexibility of the rock crab.]",

              An urbanization case study",
  author   = "Samuelson, Ash E and Leadbeater, Ellouise",
  abstract = "Land-use change is one of the most important drivers of
              widespread declines in pollinator populations. Comprehensive
              quantitative methods for land classification are critical to
              understanding these effects, but co-option of existing
              human-focussed land classifications is often inappropriate for
              pollinator research. Here, we present a flexible GIS-based land
              classification protocol for pollinator research using a bottom-up
              approach driven by reference to pollinator ecology, with
              urbanization as a case study. Our multistep method involves
              manually generating land cover maps at multiple biologically
              relevant radii surrounding study sites using GIS, with a focus on
              identifying land cover types that have a specific relevance to
              pollinators. This is followed by a three-step refinement process
              using statistical tools: (i) definition of land-use categories,
              (ii) principal components analysis on the categories, and (iii)
              cluster analysis to generate a categorical land-use variable for
              use in subsequent analysis. Model selection is then used to
              determine the appropriate spatial scale for analysis. We
              demonstrate an application of our protocol using a case study of
              38 sites across a gradient of urbanization in South-East England.
              In our case study, the land classification generated a
              categorical land-use variable at each of four radii based on the
              clustering of sites with different degrees of urbanization, open
              land, and flower-rich habitat. Studies of land-use effects on
              pollinators have historically employed a wide array of land
              classification techniques from descriptive and qualitative to
              complex and quantitative. We suggest that land-use studies in
              pollinator ecology should broadly adopt GIS-based multistep land
              classification techniques to enable robust analysis and aid
              comparative research. Our protocol offers a customizable approach
              that combines specific relevance to pollinator research with the
              potential for application to a wide range of ecological
              questions, including agroecological studies of pest control.",

               (PERMANOVA) is a geometric partitioning of variation across a

               chosen dissimilarity measure, in response to one or more factors

               quantitative covariates, repeated measures, unbalanced and/or
               asymmetrical designs, and, most recently, heterogeneous
